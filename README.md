# Using R to analyse your data with mixed effects regression models

July 12, 2018 for the 13rd meetup of R-Ladies Paris. 

Welcomed by ENS and supported by DEC-Life. 

* Mixed effects regression models (Naomi Havron)
* Interactions and parsimonious models (Nura Sidarus)

Both presentations are in [Worshop_on_MEM.pptx](https://github.com/rladies-paris/2018-07-12_Mixed_effect_regression_models/Workshop_on_MEM.pptx) (the begining is Naomi's slides and it's ending by Nura slides).

Same way, both codes are in the same R script ([R_code-12-jul.R](https://github.com/rladies-paris/2018-07-12_Mixed_effect_regression_models/R_code-12-jul.R)).

Data used for the example are in [lexicalpriming.csv](2018-07-12_Mixed_effect_regression_models/lexicalpriming.csv). The goal with this dataset is to find which factors is influent on the speed for finding if a word is a true word or if it isn't a real word.
